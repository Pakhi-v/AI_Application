#List of programs
Problem 1: Solve “Tower of Hanoi” with only 2 disks and then 3 disks.
Problem 2: Solve “4-Queens” and “8-Queens” puzzle.
Problem 3: Solve “4-color map” problem.
Problem 4: Solve “8 – puzzle” and “15-puzzle” take any initial and goal state.
Problem 5:  Solve “Latin Square” problem.
Problem 6: Code the game: Tick-Tack-Toe.
Problem 7: Code the game: Checkers.
Problem 8: Write a program to solve water jug problem.
“You are given an m liter jug and a n liter jug. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs don’t have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to measure d liters of water where d is less than n.”
Problem 9: Write a Program to Implement Missionaries-Cannibals Problems.
“In this problem, three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat which can carry at most two people, under the constraint that, for both banks, that the missionaries present on the bank cannot be outnumbered by cannibals. The boat cannot cross the river by itself with no people on board.”
Problem 10: Write a program to solve traveling salesman problem.
“Given a set of cities and distances between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.”
Problem 11: Write a Program to Implement Camel and Banana Puzzle. 
“A person has 3000 bananas and a camel. The person wants to transport the maximum number of bananas to a destination which is 1000 KMs away, using only the camel as a mode of transportation. The camel cannot carry more than 1000 bananas at a time and eats a banana every km it travels. What is the maximum number of bananas that can be transferred to the destination using only camel (no other mode of transportation is allowed).”
Problem 12: Write a program of Magic Square. 
“A magic square of order n is an arrangement of n2 numbers, usually distinct integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals sum to the same constant.”
Problem 13: Knight’s Tour problem using Backtracking. 
“Given an N*N board with the Knight placed on the first block of an empty board. Moving according to the rules of chess knight must visit each square exactly once. Print the order of each cell in which they are visited.”
Problem 14: Code the game software: Chess.  
Problem 15: K-Means Algorithm for Colour Compression.
“One interesting application of clustering is in colour compression within images. For example,imagine you have an image with millions of colours. In most images, a large number of the colours will be unused, and many of the pixels in the image will have similar or even identical colours.”
